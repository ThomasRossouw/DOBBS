## Changes made based on Lecturer Feedback

 * I have taken the videos that display the functionality out of Powerpoint (.ppt) format.
 * I used a software known as Handbrake to help compress the size of the mp4 formated videos. 
 * Within the program you will notice that within the textboxes that prompt the User's no letters can be entered unless a word is required.
 * It has been important to show the lecturer that I have tried to implement more within every task.
